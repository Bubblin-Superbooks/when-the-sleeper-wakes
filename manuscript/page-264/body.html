But surely you&rsquo;ve heard? No? Why? He bought all the patent rights and made a big company. In those days there were grosses of grosses of separate businesses and business companies. Grosses of grosses! His roads killed the railroads&mdash;the old things&mdash;in two dozen years; he bought up and Eadhamited the tracks. And because he didn&rsquo;t want to break up his great property or let in shareholders, he left it all to the Sleeper, and put it under a Board of Trustees that he had picked and trained. He knew then the Sleeper wouldn&rsquo;t wake, that he would go on sleeping, sleeping till he died.</p></div> </div>
