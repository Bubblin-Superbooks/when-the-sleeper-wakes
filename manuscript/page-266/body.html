Money attracts money&mdash;and twelve brains are better than one. They played it cleverly. They worked politics with money, and kept on adding to the money by working currency and tariffs. They grew&mdash;they grew. And for years the twelve trustees hid the growing of the Sleeper&rsquo;s estate, under double names and company titles and all that. The Council spread by title deed, mortgage, share, every political party, every newspaper, they bought. If you listen to the old stories you will see the Council growing and growing. Billions and billions of lions at last&mdash;the Sleeper&rsquo;s estate. And all growing out of a whim&mdash;out of this Warming&rsquo;s will, and an accident to Isbister&rsquo;s sons.</p></div> </div>
