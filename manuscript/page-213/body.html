A voice called that enigmatical word &ldquo;Ostrog.&rdquo; All his impressions were vague save the massive emotion of that trampling song. The multitude were beating time with their feet&mdash;marking time, tramp, tramp, tramp, tramp. The green weapons waved, flashed and slanted. Then he saw those nearest to him on a level space before the stage were marching in front of him, passing towards a great archway, shouting &ldquo;To the Council!&rdquo; Tramp, tramp, tramp, tramp. He raised his arm, and the roaring was redoubled. He remembered he had to shout &ldquo;March!&rdquo; His mouth shaped inaudible heroic words. He waved his arm again and pointed to the archway, shouting &ldquo;Onward!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
