<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Perhaps that does not seem so terrible to you. In your days men starved in your streets. That was bad. But they died&mdash;men. These people in blue&mdash;. The proverb runs: &lsquo;Blue canvas once and ever.&rsquo; The Company trades in their labour, and it has taken care to assure itself of the supply. People come to it starving and helpless&mdash;they eat and sleep for a night and day, they&mdash;work for a day, and at the end of the day they go out again. If they have worked well they have a penny or so&mdash;enough for a theatre or a cheap dancing place, or a kinematograph story, or a dinner or a bet. They wander about after that is spent. Begging is prevented by the police of the ways. Besides, no one gives. They come back again the next day or the day after&mdash;brought back by the same incapacity that brought them first.</p></div> </div>
