To-day&mdash;they are already murmuring against those who have overthrown the Council.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said Graham. &ldquo;They shouted because their lives were dreary, without joy or pride, and because in me&mdash;in me&mdash;they hoped.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And what was their hope? What is their hope? What right have they to hope? They work ill and they want the reward of those who work well. The hope of mankind&mdash;what is it? That some day the Over-man may come, that some day the inferior, the weak and the bestial may be subdued or eliminated. Subdued if not eliminated. The world is no place for the bad, the stupid, the enervated. Their duty&mdash;it&rsquo;s a fine duty too!&mdash;is to die.</p></div> </div>
