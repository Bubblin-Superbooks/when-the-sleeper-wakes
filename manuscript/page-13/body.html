<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I said, I will do this, and to do it, to overcome the inertia of this dull body, I resorted to drugs. Great God, I&rsquo;ve had enough of drugs! I don&rsquo;t know if you feel the heavy inconvenience of the body, its exasperating demand of time from the mind&mdash;time&mdash;life! Live! We only live in patches. We have to eat, and then comes the dull digestive complacencies&mdash;or irritations. We have to take the air or else our thoughts grow sluggish, stupid, run into gulfs and blind alleys. A thousand distractions arise from within and without, and then comes drowsiness and sleep. Men seem to live for sleep. How little of a man&rsquo;s day is his own&mdash;even at the best! And then come those false friends, those Thug helpers, the alkaloids that stifle natural fatigue and kill rest&mdash;black coffee, cocaine&mdash;&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
