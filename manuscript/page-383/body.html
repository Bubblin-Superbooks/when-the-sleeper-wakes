<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The Surveyor-General, in effect, endorsed the old man&rsquo;s words. &ldquo;We have abolished Cram,&rdquo; he said, a phrase Graham was beginning to interpret as the abolition of all sustained work. The Surveyor-General became sentimental. &ldquo;We try and make the elementary schools very pleasant for the little children. They will have to work so soon. Just a few simple principles&mdash;obedience&mdash;industry.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You teach them very little?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why should we? It only leads to trouble and discontent. We amuse them. Even as it is&mdash;there are troubles&mdash;agitations. Where the labourers get the ideas, one cannot tell. They tell one another. There are socialistic dreams&mdash;anarchy even! Agitators will get to work among them. I take it&mdash;I have always taken it&mdash;that my foremost duty is to fight against popular discontent. Why should people be made unhappy?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
