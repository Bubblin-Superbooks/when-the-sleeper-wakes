He seemed curious to learn all that had happened, pleased to hear of the extraordinary delight and interest which Graham took in flying Graham was in a mood of enthusiasm. &ldquo;I must learn to fly,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I must master that. I pity all poor souls who have died without this opportunity. The sweet swift air! It is the most wonderful experience in the world.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You will find our new times full of wonderful experiences,&rdquo; said Lincoln. &ldquo;I do not know what you will care to do now. We have music that may seem novel.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;For the present,&rdquo; said Graham, &ldquo;flying holds me. Let me learn more of that. Your aeronaut was saying there is some trades union objection to one&rsquo;s learning.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
