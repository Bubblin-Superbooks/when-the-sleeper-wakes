<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Mislaid! Think of the disorder of things! Think of this foolish tumult, that cannot even find its weapons! Oh, for one aeropile&mdash;just one! For the want of that I am beaten. Humanity is beaten and our cause is lost! My kingship, my headlong foolish kingship will not last a night. And I have egged on the people to fight&mdash;.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They would have fought anyhow.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I doubt it. I have come among them&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;not that. If defeat comes&mdash;if you die&mdash;. But even that cannot be, it cannot be, after all these years.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
