To the east and south the great circular shapes of complaining wind-wheels blotted out the heavens, so that the glare about the Council House was hidden. To the south-west hung Orion, showing like a pallid ghost through a tracery of iron-work and interlacing shapes above a dazzling coruscation of lights. A bellowing and siren screaming that came from the flying stages warned the world that one of the aeroplanes was ready to start. He remained for a space gazing towards the glaring stage. Then his eyes went back to the northward constellations.</p><p>For a long time he was silent. &ldquo;This,&rdquo; he said at last, smiling in the shadow, &ldquo;seems the strangest thing of all. To stand in the dome of Saint Paul&rsquo;s and look once more upon these familiar, silent stars!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
