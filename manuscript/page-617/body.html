God knows what this night will see&mdash;but not dishonour.&rdquo;</p><p>He paused. He addressed himself to the unseen multitudes who stared upon him through those grotesque black eyes. At first he spoke slowly. &ldquo;Men and women of the new age,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;You have arisen to do battle for the race... There is no easy victory before us.&rdquo;</p><p>He stopped to gather words. The thoughts that had been in his mind before she came returned, but transfigured, no longer touched with the shadow of a possible irrelevance. &ldquo;This night is a beginning,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;This battle that is coming, this battle that rushes upon us to-night, is only a beginning. All your lives, it may be, you must fight. Take no thought though I am beaten, though I am utterly overthrown.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
