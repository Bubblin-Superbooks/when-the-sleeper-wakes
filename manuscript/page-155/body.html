We dare not suddenly&mdash;while you are still half awake.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t do,&rdquo; said Graham. &ldquo;Suppose it is as you say&mdash;why am I not being crammed night and day with facts and warnings and all the wisdom of the time to fit me for my responsibilities? Am I any wiser now than two days ago, if it is two days, when I awoke?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
