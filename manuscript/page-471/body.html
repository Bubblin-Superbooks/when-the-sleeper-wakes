<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;What is this Labour Company?&rdquo; asked Graham.</p><p>&ldquo;In the old times, how did you manage with starving people?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There was the workhouse&mdash;which the parishes maintained.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Workhouse! Yes&mdash;there was something. In our history lessons. I remember now. The Labour Company ousted the workhouse. It grew&mdash;partly&mdash;out of something&mdash;you, perhaps, may remember it&mdash;an emotional religious organisation called the Salvation Army&mdash;that became a business company. In the first place it was almost a charity. To save people from workhouse rigours. Now I come to think of it, it was one of the earliest properties your Trustees acquired. They bought the Salvation Army and reconstructed it as this. The idea in the first place was to give work to starving homeless people.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
