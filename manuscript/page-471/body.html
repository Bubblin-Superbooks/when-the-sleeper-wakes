<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nowadays there are no workhouses, no refuges and charities, nothing but that Company. Its offices are everywhere. That blue is its colour. And any man, woman or child who comes to be hungry and weary and with neither home nor friend nor resort, must go to the Company in the end&mdash;or seek some way of death. The Euthanasy is beyond their means&mdash;for the poor there is no easy death. And at any hour in the day or night there is food, shelter and a blue uniform for all comers&mdash;that is the first condition of the Company&rsquo;s incorporation&mdash;and in return for a day&rsquo;s shelter the Company extracts a day&rsquo;s work, and then returns the visitor&rsquo;s proper clothing and sends him or her out again.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
