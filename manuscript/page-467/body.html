I have been made to think, for my life&mdash;has not been happy. Men are no longer free&mdash;no greater, no better than the men of your time. That is not all. This city&mdash;is a prison.

Yes, far worse than in your time. All about us, beneath us, sorrow and pain. All the shallow delight of such life as you find about you, is separated by just a little from a life of wretchedness beyond any telling Yes, the poor know it&mdash;they know they suffer. These countless multitudes who faced death for you two nights since&mdash;! You owe your life to them.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
