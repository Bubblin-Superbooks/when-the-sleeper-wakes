And we have an institution called Euthanasy.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah! that Euthanasy!&rdquo; said Graham. &ldquo;The easy death?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The easy death. It is the last pleasure. The Euthanasy Company does it well. People will pay the sum&mdash;it is a costly thing&mdash;long beforehand, go off to some pleasure city and return impoverished and weary, very weary.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There is a lot left for me to understand,&rdquo; said Graham after a pause. &ldquo;Yet I see the logic of it all. Our array of angry virtues and sour restraints was the consequence of danger and insecurity. The Stoic, the Puritan, even in my time, were vanishing types. In the old days man was armed against Pain, now he is eager for Pleasure.</p></div> </div>
