<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;But haven&rsquo;t the Council flying machines? Why is there no fighting with them?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They had. But the greater part of the aeronauts were in the revolt with us. They wouldn&rsquo;t take the risk of fighting on our side, but they would not stir against us. We had to get a pull with the aeronauts. Quite half were with us, and the others knew it. Directly they knew you had got away, those looking for you dropped. We killed the man who shot at you&mdash;an hour ago. And we occupied the flying stages at the outset in every city we could, and so stopped and captured the airplanes, and as for the little flying machines that turned out&mdash;for some did&mdash;we kept up too straight and steady a fire for them to get near the Council House. If they dropped they couldn&rsquo;t rise again, because there&rsquo;s no clear space about there for them to get up.</p></div> </div>
