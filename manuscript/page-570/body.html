<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Graham heard someone shouting. &ldquo;Stop all work. Stop all work,&rdquo; and a swarthy hunchback, ridiculously gay in green and gold, came leaping down the platforms toward him, bawling again and again in good English, &ldquo;This is Ostrog&rsquo;s doing, Ostrog, the Knave! The Master is betrayed.&rdquo; His voice was hoarse and a thin foam dropped from his ugly shouting mouth. He yelled an unspeakable horror that the Black Police had done in Paris, and so passed shrieking, &ldquo;Ostrog the Knave!&rdquo;</p><p>For a moment Graham stood still, for it had come upon him again that these things were a dream. He looked up at the great cliff of buildings on either side, vanishing into blue haze at last above the lights, and down to the roaring tiers of platforms, and the shouting, running people who were gesticulating past. &ldquo;The Master is betrayed!&rdquo; they cried. &ldquo;The Master is betrayed!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
