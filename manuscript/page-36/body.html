<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;You came back by the trap that took me to Camelford railway station. It was close on the Jubilee, Victoria&rsquo;s Jubilee, because I remember the seats and flags in Westminster, and the row with the cabman at Chelsea.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The Diamond Jubilee, it was,&rdquo; said Warming; &ldquo;the second one.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, yes! At the proper Jubilee&mdash;the Fifty Year affair&mdash;I was down at Wookey&mdash;a boy. I missed all that.... What a fuss we had with him! My landlady wouldn&rsquo;t take him in, wouldn&rsquo;t let him stay&mdash;he looked so queer when he was rigid. We had to carry him in a chair up to the hotel. And the Boscastle doctor&mdash;it wasn&rsquo;t the present chap, but the G.P. before him&mdash;was at him until nearly two, with, me and the landlord holding lights and so forth.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
