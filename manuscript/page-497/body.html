That is the path by which the beast rose to manhood, by which man goes on to higher things.&rdquo;</p><p>Ostrog took a pace, seemed to think, and turned on Graham. &ldquo;I can imagine how this great world state of ours seems to a Victorian Englishman. You regret all the old forms of representative government&mdash;their spectres still haunt the world, the voting councils and parliaments and all that eighteenth century tomfoolery You feel moved against our Pleasure Cities. I might have thought of that,&mdash;had I not been busy. But you will learn better. The people are mad with envy&mdash;they would be in sympathy with you. Even in the streets now, they clamour to destroy the Pleasure Cities. But the Pleasure Cities are the excretory organs of the State, attractive places that year after year draw together all that is weak and vicious, all that is lascivious and lazy, all the easy roguery of the world, to a graceful destruction.</p></div> </div>
