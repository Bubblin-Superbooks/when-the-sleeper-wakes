There is a sort of oppression, a weight. No&mdash;not drowsiness, would God it were! It is like a shadow, a deep shadow falling suddenly and swiftly across something busy. Spin, spin into the darkness. The tumult of thought, the confusion, the eddy and eddy. I can&rsquo;t express it. I can hardly keep my mind on it&mdash;steadily enough to tell you.&rdquo;</p><p>He stopped feebly.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t trouble, old chap,&rdquo; said Isbister. &ldquo;I think I can understand. At any rate, it don&rsquo;t matter very much just at present about telling me, you know.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
