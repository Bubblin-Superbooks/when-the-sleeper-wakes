But first we must get you black robes&mdash;for black is your colour. Do you mind? And then they will disperse to their homes.&rdquo;</p><p>Graham hesitated. &ldquo;I am in your hands,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>Ostrog was clearly of that opinion. He thought for a moment, turned to the curtain and called brief directions to some unseen attendants. Almost immediately a black robe, the very fellow of the black robe Graham had worn in the theatre, was brought. And as he threw it about his shoulders there came from the room without the shrilling of a high-pitched bell. Ostrog turned in interrogation to the attendant, then suddenly seemed to change his mind, pulled the curtain aside and disappeared.</p></div> </div>
