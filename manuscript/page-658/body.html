And even as this man cheered, and while the beads of sweat still chased one another from the disorder of his hair, he heard the thunder of a greater tumult, and in fitful snatches the beat and impulse of the revolutionary song. He saw through a gap in the people that a thick stream of heads still poured up the stairway. &ldquo;The Master is coming,&rdquo; shouted voices, &ldquo;the Master is coming,&rdquo; and the crowd about him grew denser and denser. He began to thrust himself towards the central groove. &ldquo;The Master is coming!&rdquo; &ldquo;The Sleeper, the Master!&rdquo; &ldquo;God and the Master!&rdquo; roared the Voices.</p></div> </div>
