The whole world was exploited, a battle field of businesses; and financial convulsions, the scourge of currency manipulation, tariff wars, made more human misery during the twentieth century&mdash;because the wretchedness was dreary life instead of speedy death&mdash;than had war, pestilence and famine, in the darkest hours of earlier history.</p></div> </div>
