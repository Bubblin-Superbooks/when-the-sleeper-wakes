<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Over a great part of the earth the English tongue was spoken; taken together with its Spanish American and Hindoo and Negro and &ldquo;Pidgin&rdquo; dialects, it was the everyday language of two-thirds of the people of the earth. On the Continent, save as remote and curious survivals, three other languages alone held sway&mdash;German, which reached to Antioch and Genoa and jostled Spanish-English at Gdiz, a Gallicised Russian which met the Indian English in Persia and Kurdistan and the &ldquo;Pidgin&rdquo; English in Pekin, and French still clear and brilliant, the language of lucidity, which shared the Mediterranean with the Indian English and German and reached through a negro dialect to the Congo.</p><p>And everywhere now, through the city-set earth, save in the administered &ldquo;black belt&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
