<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>As Asano and Graham hurried along to the ruins about the Council House, they saw everywhere the excitement of the people rising. &ldquo;To your Wards To your Wards!&rdquo; Everywhere men and women in blue were hurrying from unknown subterranean employments, up the staircases of the middle path&mdash;at one place Graham saw an arsenal of the revolutionary committee besieged by a crowd of shouting men, at another a couple of men in the hated yellow uniform of the Labour Police, pursued by a gathering crowd, fled precipitately along the swift way that went in the opposite direction.</p><p>The cries of &ldquo;To your Wards!&rdquo; became at last a continuous shouting as they drew near the Government quarter. Many of the shouts were unintelligible. &ldquo;Ostrog has betrayed us,&rdquo; one man bawled in a hoarse voice, again and again, dinning that refrain into Graham&rsquo;s ear until it haunted him.</p></div> </div>
