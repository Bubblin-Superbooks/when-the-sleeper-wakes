<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The man with the fair beard made some inaudible remark, and Graham looking over his shoulder saw approaching a very short, fat, and thickset beardless man, with aquiline nose and heavy neck and chin. Very thick black and slightly sloping eyebrows that almost met over his nose and overhung deep grey eyes, gave his face an oddly formidable expression. He scowled momentarily at Graham and then his regard returned to the man with the flaxen beard. &ldquo;These others,&rdquo; he said in a voice of extreme irritation. &ldquo;You had better go.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Go?&rdquo; said the red-bearded man.</p><p>&ldquo;Certainly&mdash;go now. But see the doorways are closed as you go.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
