Well, gentlemen who dress in silk must have their fun.&rdquo; A withered hand caressed Graham&rsquo;s arm for a moment. &ldquo;Silk. Well, well! But, all the same, I wish I was the man who was put up as the Sleeper. He&rsquo;ll have a fine time of it. All the pomp and pleasure. He&rsquo;s a queer looking face. When they used to let anyone go to see him, I&rsquo;ve got tickets and been. The image of the real one, as the photographs show him, this substitute used to be. Yellow. But he&rsquo;ll get fed up. It&rsquo;s a queer world. Think of the luck of it. The luck of it. I expect he&rsquo;ll be sent to Capri. It&rsquo;s the best fun for a greener.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
