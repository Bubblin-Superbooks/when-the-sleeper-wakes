<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Lincoln, with a graceful compliment to the attendant, apologised for not accompanying them, on account of the present pressure of administrative work.</p><p>Higher even than the most gigantic wind-wheels hung this crow&rsquo;s nest, a clear thousand feet above the roofs, a little disc-shaped speck on a spear of metallic filigree, cable stayed. To its summit Graham was drawn in a little wire-hung cradle. Halfway down the frail-seeming stem was a light gallery about which hung a cluster of tubes&mdash;minute they looked from above&mdash;rotating slowly on the ring of its outer rail. These were the specula, en rapport with the wind-vane keeper&rsquo;s mirrors, in one of which Ostrog had shown him the coming of his rule. His Japanese attendant ascended before him and they spent nearly an hour asking and answering questions.</p></div> </div>
