An archaic shame came upon him. He became acutely aware that he was visible to a great number of interested people. &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; he remarked inadequately. He turned awkwardly away from her, fascinating facility. He looked about him to meet a number of eyes that immediately occupied themselves with other things. Possibly he coloured a little. &ldquo;Who is that talking with the lady in saffron?&rdquo; he asked, avoiding her eyes.</p><p>The person in question he learnt was one of the great organisers of the American theatres just fresh from a gigantic production at Mexico.
